// it's important to keep this to bytes only and to 2 fields
// ALL key value replicated datastores work with envelopes of bytes
// adding fields like `uint64 wall_time=1` may seem perfectly reasonable
// at first, but it promotes byte copying as you then have to serialize the
// bytes to a bigger byte array and save it. On deserialization you do the same
// so from disk to client you usually incur about 4 serializations
// [send_client] + [recv_server] + [recv_database_format] + [copy_to_disk]
//
// This saves about 2 {ser,deser}ializations with rocksdb, for example.
// This may be a limitation, and we'll consider changes w/ proper benchmarks
// and unit tests
//
// Do not edit
